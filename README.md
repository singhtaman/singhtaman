## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on generic_precession waveforms - spin-spin coupling's distinguishability in gravitational wave signals from binary black holes
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with/to collaborate on network analysis of a GW signal.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my research on tidal disruption events (TDEs), and regular_precession waveforms (GWs)!!
